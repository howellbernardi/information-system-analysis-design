# information-system-analysis-design
A system analysis and design project for an app called **BidNow**, which is a fictional online auction platform focused on antique items.   This project was created as part of the **Information Systems Analysis &amp; Design (ISAD)** coursework.

## Project Overview
BidNow is an **auction-style e-commerce system** where users can register, bid on antiques, participate in forums, and track their transactions. The project focuses on analyzing system requirements and modeling workflows using **UML diagrams** and **use case scenarios**.

## Objectives
- Analyze the requirements of an auction information system.  
- Model user interactions, workflows, and system processes using UML.  
- Design key entities and their relationships through class diagrams.  
- Document complete **use cases** including flows, exceptions, and stakeholders.

## Contents
- **Use Case Diagrams & Descriptions** – Detailed user actions and system responses.  
- **Activity Diagrams** – Step-by-step workflows for core functions.  
- **Class Diagram** – Data structures and relationships between system entities.  
- **State Machine Diagram** – Status flow for core objects (e.g., `Form Penawaran`).  
- **Sequence Diagrams** – Interaction flows for registration, bidding, forum posts, replies, and shipping.  
- **CRUD Mapping** – Linking use cases with database operations.

## Tools & Methodologies
- **Modeling Language**: UML (Use Case, Activity, Class, Sequence, State Machine)  
- **Methodology**: System Analysis & Design (ISAD coursework)  
- **Core Skills**: Requirements Analysis, Diagramming, CRUD Mapping
